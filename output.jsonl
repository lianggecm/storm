Harnessing the Power of LLMs – A Strategic Approach to Future Manufacturing\nAs we navigate the future of manufacturing, it’s clear that large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and AI solutions like Vanti’s generative AI are not just tools but transformative forces that are redefining the industry. Everything you need to know about Generative AI in Manufacturing\nHow LLM Applications are Revolutionizing the Manufacturing Industry\nLLM Applications for Production – An Overview\nIf you haven’t heard already, Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude2 or LLaMa2 are poised to transform manufacturing in major ways. Large Language Models in Manufacturing – Driving Predictive Insights\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the biggest values of LLMs in manufacturing is their ability to analyze massive amounts of data and identify patterns. The ability of LLMs to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and generate human-like text and insights is driving efficiency, reducing costs, and improving product quality.\n[9]: Note we place task instruction before demonstration examples for two reasons: (i) It follows the natural progression of teaching the model to finish a task, i.e., introducing the problem before showing how to solve it; (ii) Instruction provides the contextual information for the examples, making the model easier to build connection between the examples and task purpose (e.g., given the query rewrite instruction, the model can focus on the structural changes in the examples). We propose to design and train a database-specific LLM with (i) validity checking for the output of LLMs, (ii) structural information learning from numerous database logs (composed of various workloads, optimization actions, and even result data) and (iii) federated learning that preserves data privacy during training the LLM.\n2 Opportunities of Using LLMs for DB\n2.1 Overview\nAs shown in Fig. 2, this section presents three strategies that leverage LLMs to optimize database tasks, including input prompt generation (Sect. 2.2), database-specific LLM fine-tuning (Sect. 2.3), and database-specific LLM design and pre-training (Sect. 2.4). Finally, we concatenate the instruction, collected features, and the input into a prompt sequence, and rely on the LLM to output desired results based on the prompt sequence.\n3.2\nDB-GPT for Query Rewrite\nDatasets We generate instructions on the training set and verify the performance on the evaluation set. Task 2: Index Tuning Similarly, the index tuning task involves (i) the main procedure (e.g., creating a sequence of indexes) and task target (e.g., reducing the latency within limited space) and (ii) examples like inputting a two-table join query and outputting two indexes that use the columns in the queries and (iii) the input including some new queries, for which we need to create suitable indexes.

Large Language Models in Manufacturing – Driving Predictive Insights\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the biggest values of LLMs in manufacturing is their ability to analyze massive amounts of data and identify patterns. The ability of LLMs to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and generate human-like text and insights is driving efficiency, reducing costs, and improving product quality.\n[2]\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impacted our perspective on applying Machine Learning (ML) in semiconductor test. This paper shares our experience in leveraging the power of LLMs to build an AI agent for test data analytics. We advocate for an end-to-end approach where the Knowledge Graph (KG) plays a central role.\n[3]\nTo focus on this LLM’s conversation skills would be to misunderstand just how powerful this technology stands to be in solving some of chip design’s most pressing challenges—automating the workflow to reduce errors introduced by humans in creating the design specification, the design itself, and all the project documents needed to create a complex semiconductor device.\nIn the nine short months since OpenAI brought ChatGPT (a Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) and the phenomenal concept of large language models (LLMs) to the global collective consciousness, pioneers from every corner of the economy have raced to understand the benefits—and the pitfalls—of deploying this nascent technology to their particular industry.

An ambiguous problem\nThe starting point for the design of any silicon chip is a high-level hardware and software specification, described in a natural language such as English, to capture as much detail from as diverse a set of engineers as possible.\n[4]\nNote we place task instruction before demonstration examples for two reasons: (i) It follows the natural progression of teaching the model to finish a task, i.e., introducing the problem before showing how to solve it; (ii) Instruction provides the contextual information for the examples, making the model easier to build connection between the examples and task purpose (e.g., given the query rewrite instruction, the model can focus on the structural changes in the examples). We propose to design and train a database-specific LLM with (i) validity checking for the output of LLMs, (ii) structural information learning from numerous database logs (composed of various workloads, optimization actions, and even result data) and (iii) federated learning that preserves data privacy during training the LLM.\n2 Opportunities of Using LLMs for DB\n2.1 Overview\nAs shown in Fig. 2, this section presents three strategies that leverage LLMs to optimize database tasks, including input prompt generation (Sect. 2.2), database-specific LLM fine-tuning (Sect. 2.3), and database-specific LLM design and pre-training (Sect. 2.4). Finally, we concatenate the instruction, collected features, and the input into a prompt sequence, and rely on the LLM to output desired results based on the prompt sequence.\n3.2\nDB-GPT for Query Rewrite\nDatasets We generate instructions on the training set and verify the performance on the evaluation set. Task 2: Index Tuning Similarly, the index tuning task involves (i) the main procedure (e.g., creating a sequence of indexes) and task target (e.g., reducing the latency within limited space) and (ii) examples like inputting a two-table join query and outputting two indexes that use the columns in the queries and (iii) the input including some new queries, for which we need to create suitable indexes.
